Kameleon recipes
----------------

The defaults kameleon recipes. 

Use them as templates to create your own recipes. See:
http://kameleon.imag.fr/getting_started.html#create-a-new-recipe-from-template

Also, recipes in the from_scratch directory are the ones used to create the "upstream builds" provided at
http://kameleon.imag.fr/builds/
These "from_scratch" recipes use qemu as virtualization backend.

Basic examples of use of these upstream builds are provided in the from_upstream_build directory. These recipes support many virtualization backends, such as qemu, virtualbox.
