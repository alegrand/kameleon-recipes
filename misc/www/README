This directory contains continuous integration builds of Kameleon "from_scratch" upstream recipes, located at:
 https://github.com/oar-team/kameleon-recipes

For each build of a recipe, a manifest file lists the related files.

Builds are pushed on a regular basis, to keep them up to date with the latest distribution updates (packages), even if recipes themselves may not change.

For every recipe, only the latest 2 builds are kept: older builds are dropped upon the arrival of a new build.
(If only old builds are listed for a recipe, mind that it might mean the recipe is currently broken.)

We advise you to use the latest build and store it on your side if needed for your usage.

The latest build manifest for a recipe can be retrieved using the following URL:
 http://kameleon.imag.fr/builds/RECIPE_latest.manifest

Finally, manifest and checksum files are gpg-signed by the Kameleon Builder <kameleonbuilder@kameleon.imag.fr> (fingerprint: 89A7 DDB3 8C19 58E2 8841  C1AF 1741 A017 CA22 303C)
